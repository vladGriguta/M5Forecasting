# M5Forecasting
Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview

### Initial thoughts

This is the initial kaggle competition I am embarking. With some experience in time series forecasting, I would like to get a feel of the challenges of applying this methods to an industry which is different from the one I am working in.
My plan for the initial day of work on this project is to get a model working and submit a result whatever accuracy can I get.


### Action list:

1. Understand the format of the input data

2. Comprime the data to save space

3. Run the most simplistic forecasting algorithm on the comprimed dataset

4. Compute the accuracy metric.

5. Submit the result
