Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview

### Initial thoughts

This is the initial kaggle competition I am embarking. With some experience in time series forecasting, I would like to get a feel of the challenges of applying this methods to an industry which is different from the one I am working in.
My plan for the initial day of work on this project is to get a model working and submit a result whatever accuracy can I get.
